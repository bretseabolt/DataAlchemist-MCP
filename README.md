# DataAlchemist-MCP

Welcome to DataAlchemist-MCP, a tool for data analysis and manipulation. This project is currently in its initial development phase, providing foundational data summarization capabilities.

## Description

DataAlchemist-MCP is designed to be a powerful and intuitive application for working with datasets. The long-term vision is to create a comprehensive tool that can perform a wide range of data operations, transformations, and analyses.

**Current Version (v0.3.0):**
* Loads a dataset from a .csv file
* Provides a basic summary of the data, including key statistics.
* Performs various data preprocessing techniques
* Splits data into training and test sets
* Models data with a linear regression model

This is the most basic version of the application. Future releases will expand its capabilities to include more advanced data manipulation and analysis features.

## Technologies Used

* **Language:** Python
* **Frameworks:** LangGraph, LangChain, Pydantic, Model Context Protocol (MCP)
* **Core Libraries:** Polar, scikit-learn
* **Development Environment:** PyCharm
* **User Interface:**: Streamlit
